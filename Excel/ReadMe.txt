0. Do not pay attention to the warning when you first start through VS, I do not know why this happened :)
1. Implemented all functionality, including additional.
2. Zoom is used by the library using the mouse buttons.
3. Used NuGet packages:
Newtonsoft.Json
LiveCharts
LiveCharts.WinForms
LiveCharts.Wpf
If the dependencies "break", go to the NuGet manager and Visual Studio will offer to reconnect these packages, click on the Restore button, then unload the project (Unload porject) and reload (Reload project). Otherwise, reinstall these packages.
Try to simulate excel work:)
